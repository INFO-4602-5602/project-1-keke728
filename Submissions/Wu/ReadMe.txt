*I modified the web background to a tree rings and changed the fonts accordingly to match this vintage design style.

Whistles: Replication 
*I used Tableau to replicate these charts, the differences between these two tools were obvious. Tableau was faster and easier under some conditions, however D3 can shape our visualizations as the way we like. It could be painful when you get stuck in one of the functions but overall programming is more flexible.
